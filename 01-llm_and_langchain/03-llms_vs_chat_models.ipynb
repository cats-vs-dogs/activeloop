    "##### LLMs\n",
    "\n",
    "LLMs, such as GPT-3, Bloom, PaLM, and Aurora genAI, take a text string as input and return a text string as output. They are trained on language modeling tasks and can generate human-like text, perform complex reasoning, and even write code. LLMs are powerful and flexible, capable of generating text for a wide range of tasks. However, they can sometimes produce incorrect or nonsensical answers, and their API is less structured compared to Chat Models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pre-training these models involves presenting large-scale corpora to them and allowing the network to predict the next word, which results in learning the relationships between words. This learning process enables LLMs to generate high-quality text, which can be applied to an array of applications, such as automatic form-filling and predictive text on smartphones.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of these models are trained on general purpose training dataset, while others are trained on a mix of general and domain-specific data, such as Intel Aurora genAI, which is trained on general text, scientific texts, scientific data, and codes related to the domain. The goal of domain specific LLMs is to increase the performance on a particularly domain, while still being able to solve the majority of tasks that general LLM can manage.\n",
    "\n",
    "LLMs have the potential to infiltrate various aspects of human life, including the arts, sciences, and law. With continued development, LLMs will become increasingly integrated into our educational, personal, and professional lives, making them an essential technology to master.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can follow these steps to use a large language model (LLM) like GPT-3 in LangChain. Import the **OpenAI** wrapper from the **langchain.llms** module and Initialize it with the desired model name and any additional arguments. For example, set a high temperature for more random outputs. Then, create a **PromptTemplate** to format the input for the model. Lastly, define an **LLMChain** to combine the model and prompt. Run the chain with the desired input using **.run()**"

    "#### Chat Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Chat Models are the most popular models in LangChain, such as ChatGPT that can incorporate GPT-3 or GPT-4 at its core. They have gained significant attention due to their ability to learn from human feedback and their user-friendly chat interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "Chat Models, such as ChatGPT, take a list of messages as input and return an **AIMessage**. They typically use LLMs as their underlying technology, but their APIs are more structured. Chat Models are designed to remember previous exchanges with the user in a session and use that context to generate more relevant responses. They also benefit from reinforcement learning from human feedback, which helps improve their responses. However, they may still have limitations in reasoning and require careful handling to avoid generating inappropriate content.\n",
    "\n",
    "API Differences in LangChain\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Chat Message Types\n",
    "\n",
    "In LangChain, three main types of messages are used when interacting with chat models: **SystemMessage**, **HumanMessage**, and **AIMessage**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**SystemMessage**: These messages provide initial instructions, context, or data for the AI model. They set the objectives the AI should follow and can help in controlling the AI's behavior. System messages are not user inputs but rather guidelines for the AI to operate within.\n",
    "\n",
    "**HumanMessage**: These messages come from the user and represent their input to the AI model. The AI model is expected to respond to these messages. In LangChain, you can customize the human prefix (e.g., \"User\") in the conversation summary to change how the human input is represented.\n",
    "\n",
    "**AIMessage**: These messages are sent from the AI's perspective as it interacts with the human user. They represent the AI's responses to human input. Like **HumanMessage**, you can also customize the AI prefix (e.g., \"AI Assistant\" or \"AI\") in the conversation summary to change how the AI's responses are represented.\n",
    "\n",
    "**An example of using ChatOpenAI with a HumanMessage**: In this section, we are trying to use the LangChain library to create a chatbot that can translate an English sentence into French. This particular use case goes beyond what we covered in the previous lesson. We'll be employing multiple message types to differentiate between users' queries and system instructions instead of relying on a single prompt. This approach will enhance the model's comprehension of the given requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we create a list of messages, starting with a **SystemMessage** that sets the context for the chatbot, informing it that its role is to be a helpful assistant translating English to French. We then follow it with a **HumanMessage** containing the userâ€™s query, like an English sentence to be translated."
